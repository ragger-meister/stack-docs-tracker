# Replicator docs – daily check

## Context

Daily documentation scan for **Replicator**.
This note is part of the continuous tracking of upstream changes across the stack.

## Observed changes

- Upstream documentation content changed (hash comparison only).
- The exact diff is not stored here; the goal is to flag the day as
  "docs changed" so it can be reviewed manually when needed.

## Technical details

- Previous combined hash: `7d3a66219a2a81a488ce367f9f7ae539ab107b374c7b9197735901078922806b`
- New combined hash: `ba27d538d53a5e79e87956292592cd6aaec96ab565a5d57d0ed741db3cda59e9`

### Tracked sources

## Impact

- Potentially affects local notes, learning material, or code relying on
  the documented APIs/behaviour.
- Recommended to skim the relevant sections if actively working with this
  technology this week.

## Follow-up

- [ ] Review the upstream docs and identify the most relevant changes.
- [ ] Update local notes or examples if any breaking or important behavioural
      changes are found.
- [ ] (Optional) Capture a short manual summary in a separate note if the
      change is substantial.
