# Jetpack docs – daily check

## Context

Daily documentation scan for **Jetpack**.
This note is part of the continuous tracking of upstream changes across the stack.

## Observed changes

- Upstream documentation content changed (hash comparison only).
- The exact diff is not stored here; the goal is to flag the day as
  "docs changed" so it can be reviewed manually when needed.

## Technical details

- Previous combined hash: `N/A`
- New combined hash: `4bef9bf85a84f975e60591a8e6dc89c42e45cdbb2d0c8d435b60af63b2a65642`

### Tracked sources

## Impact

- Potentially affects local notes, learning material, or code relying on
  the documented APIs/behaviour.
- Recommended to skim the relevant sections if actively working with this
  technology this week.

## Follow-up

- [ ] Review the upstream docs and identify the most relevant changes.
- [ ] Update local notes or examples if any breaking or important behavioural
      changes are found.
- [ ] (Optional) Capture a short manual summary in a separate note if the
      change is substantial.
