# Ubuntu docs – daily check

            ## Context

            Daily documentation scan for **Ubuntu**.
            This note is part of the continuous tracking of upstream changes across the stack.

            ## Observed changes

            - Upstream documentation content changed (hash comparison only).
            - The exact diff is not stored here; the goal is to flag the day as
              "docs changed" so it can be reviewed manually when needed.

            ## Technical details

            - Previous combined hash: `N/A`
            - New combined hash: `fdc78159ee200c7733b9f392be6a036dd9b57fad22c206bdebd8236ce7db7490`

            ### Tracked sources

            - https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
- https://discourse.ubuntu.com/

            ## Impact

            - Potentially affects local notes, learning material, or code relying on
              the documented APIs/behaviour.
            - Recommended to skim the relevant sections if actively working with this
              technology this week.

            ## Follow-up

            - [ ] Review the upstream docs and identify the most relevant changes.
            - [ ] Update local notes or examples if any breaking or important behavioural
                  changes are found.
            - [ ] (Optional) Capture a short manual summary in a separate note if the
                  change is substantial.
